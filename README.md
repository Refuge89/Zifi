-------
This MMORPG framework was built using C++ for front-end development, and MySQL for 
back-end database management; populating the world you see with objects, creatures, and 
performing various interactions with the things you see inside of the realm.
This project was pulled from BLC in 2012, and modified by me and a few other contributors
locally, not under GitHub.
The meat of my fun can be viewed here: \src\scripts\Custom (My knowledge of coding,
coding conventions, comments, and all of the sorts, was minimal as this was my
first exposure to programming), along with the Player.cpp file in src/game, 
and all of the sql queries in the sql folder.
